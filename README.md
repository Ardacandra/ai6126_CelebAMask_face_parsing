# AI6126 CelebAMask Face Parsing
This repository contains my work for the CelebAMask Face Parsing project as part of NTU AI6126 Advanced Computer Vision class.

The goal of this mini challenge is to design and train a face parsing network using the CelebAMask-HQ Dataset. A mini-dataset consisting of 1000 training and 100 validation pairs of
images is used, where both images and annotations have a resolution of 512 x 512.

The performance of the network will be evaluated based on the F-measure between the
predicted masks and the ground truth of the test set.
